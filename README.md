# Wormcord
A 'worm' written in Rust that is designed to spread over discord by automatically grabbing tokens from appdata diretories, logging into the acocunts and sending itself through the friend list. And finally, it deletes itself. Oh yeah and it also sends a message to a webhook notifying you when someone has opened it.

If you have ideas on how to improve this please create a pull request, especially the self destruction part would need some improvements I think.

Thanks to [r-o-b-o-t-o](https://github.com/r-o-b-o-t-o) for his serenity fork and his [discord_grabber](https://github.com/heavenly/discord_grabber) that helped me with the regex stuff :)
