# Wormcord
A 'worm' written in Rust that is designed to spread over discord by automatically grabbing tokens from appdata diretories, logging into the acocunts and sending itself through the friend list. And finally, it deletes itself. Oh yeah and it also sends a message to a webhook notifying you when someone has opened it :)
