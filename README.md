# Wormcord
A 'worm' written in Rust that is designed to spread over discord by automatically grabbing tokens from appdata directories, logging into the acocunts and sending itself through the friend list. And finally, it deletes itself. Oh yeah and it also sends a message to a webhook notifying you when someone has opened it.

ALSO, the file size has to stay under 8mb (default discord upload limit) if it should function the way I intended it to, you could rewrite it to upload itself to an image host if you want to extend this of course.

If you have ideas on how to improve this please create a pull request, especially the self destruction part would need some improvements I think.

Thanks to [r-o-b-o-t-o](https://github.com/r-o-b-o-t-o) for his serenity fork and his [discord_grabber](https://github.com/heavenly/discord_grabber) that helped me with the regex stuff :)

### This project has not the intention to harm anyone! It was just an idea I came up with and thought which could be interesting to realize, im not responsible for anything you do with this!
